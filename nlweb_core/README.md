We have an abstract class BaseNLW: query, prev, and all the other args + output function
 - implements prev query decontextualizer
 - output

Subclass for ranking based NLW. Still abstract.

Subclasses for keyword base and vector based retrieval. 

prompts can be editing by someone creating the system. maybe a prompt-dictionary that overrides
 prompts in files

orchestrator class that keeps side table of sites, independent of vector stores
 and such. maybe 

 site/shopify/...
 site/azureai/...
 site/datacommons/...
